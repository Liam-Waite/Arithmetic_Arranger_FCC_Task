# FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python – Arithmetic Formatter

This repository contains my solution to the **"Arithmetic Formatter"** project, part of the **Data Analysis with Python** certification on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  

The task: write a function that formats up to five arithmetic problems in a vertically aligned, side‑by‑side display, with optional solutions.


## Project Overview

The `arithmetic_arranger` function:

- Accepts up to **five** arithmetic problems as strings  
- Validates input for:
  - Too many problems
  - Invalid operators (`+` and `-` only)
  - Non‑digit operands
  - Operands longer than four digits
- Produces a clean, column‑aligned string output
- Optionally displays solutions when `show_answers=True`

This project focuses on:
- String manipulation
- Input validation
- Clean, modular code design
